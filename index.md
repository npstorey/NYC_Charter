In the exercise of this power, the mayor may promulgate rules requiring that information obtained by city employees be kept confidential to the extent necessary to preserve the trust of individuals who have business with city agencies. To the extent set forth in such rules, each agency shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the United States and the state of New York, maintain the confidentiality of information in its possession relating to the immigration status or other private information that was provided by an individual to a city employee in the course of such employee's duties.</div></div><div class="Normal-Level"><div>   h.   The mayor shall designate the head of an office of the mayor, or of such other agency headed by a mayoral appointee as the mayor may determine, to act as the city’s chief privacy officer.
